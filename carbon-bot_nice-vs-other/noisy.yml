    - It's been changing for millions of years because the earth shifts on its axis while spinning in space. Things are going to change naturally, that's why Ohio was a glacier a million years ago and I can find salt water fossils in my backyard in middle Ga.
    - There is no climate change asshole
    - Do volcanoes do it
    - NO!  Who benefits?  Who gets the money it is going to cost me?  I despise the UN and all it embodies.  I also do not believe there is such a thing as global warming, and I sure don't agree with your climate change policy either.

    - what would they do for me>?
    - I understand but the companies are making money off my flight
    - shouldnt the airlines cover that as they are the ones already making money off my flight?
    - So the passengers are paying more to help offset the damage airplanes are doing to the environment, yet the airlines themselves are not held accountable. Got it.

    - yeah, i'm poor and shouldn't be wasting my cash.
    - Do I need to buy offsets if i just want to go home?
    - Does that mean I pay less?
    - Oh so now I can fly only if I am rich right?

    - But I don't have enough money to buy offsets
    - No I think that's only for rich people
    - How do I benefit from this?
    - but it's too late for the planet, why should i bother?
