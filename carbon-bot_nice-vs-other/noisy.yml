    - Do volcanoes do it

    - what would they do for me>?
    - I understand but the companies are making money off my flight
    - shouldnt the airlines cover that as they are the ones already making money off my flight?
    - So the passengers are paying more to help offset the damage airplanes are doing to the environment, yet the airlines themselves are not held accountable. Got it.

    - yeah, i'm poor and shouldn't be wasting my cash.
    - Do I need to buy offsets if i just want to go home?

    - But I don't have enough money to buy offsets
    - No I think that's only for rich people
    - How do I benefit from this?
    - but it's too late for the planet, why should i bother?
